                <p>Hi! I’m Riya Marwadi, an Indian-born, San Francisco-based photographer and designer with a knack for print design and illustration.
                </p>
                 <p>I am currently a junior at the University of San Francisco with plans to graduate in 2024. Growing up, I knew I wanted a career in the creative field, but I was unsure of my strengths or interests. Over the years, I developed a deep interest in photography and design. Majoring in Advertising with a design minor helped me combine my interests and develop skills like copywriting, using multiple Adobe software, and coding languages such as HTML/CSS. My goal is to become skilled enough to work in a creative position at an advertising agency. I hope to create designs with my personal touch and consistent style throughout my creative work. 
                The people around me are my biggest inspiration. My creative thought process flows well when I’m around creative people with different backgrounds.</p>
