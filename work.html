            <h2>Environment project</h2>
            <p>My project is on the environmental impact of meat consumption. I chose this topic because I can personally relate to it. I have been a vegetarian my whole life. Apart from religious reasons (we worship cows), I also believe that it is not okay to kill and slaughter animals in such mass numbers for a meal. Meat consumption is an environmental issue because it is responsible for releasing harmful greenhouse gasses such as methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide. These gases contribute to climate change as well as several cardiovascular diseases and other health conditions. According to research, 1 cow is responsible for producing/releasing around 200 pounds of methane gas. As a way of illustrating this, I used the scale effect in an image of a city and filled the sky with methane gas released by a single cow. This shows that our environment suffers directly from meat consumption. The emotions I’m trying to provoke through this poster are empathy, shock, and fear in the audience so that they become aware of just how serious this issue is. The call to action would be to try and reduce meat consumption by introducing more vegetarian options in restaurants and fast food chains. This could potentially help better the environment

            <h2>Cipe Pineles</h2>
            <p>I chose Cipe Pineles as my designer. During her career in New York, she worked for major magazines such as Seventeen, Charm, Glamour, House & Garden, Vanity Fair, and Vogue as the first female art director. She was known for introducing fine arts into mass-produced media. Her illustrations were often accompanied by hand-written lettering, in a manner that was way before its time. Her passion for food also led her to design a cookbook. She wasn’t afraid to use bold colors and different illustrations in her work and that’s what made her stand out.
                I wanted to try and implement most if not all of her qualities and so the icon itself is a magazine cover that celebrates her design work and features the New York City skyline in recognition of her NYC-based background. I also incorporated aspects of both fashion and food by merging the two in one and used bold colors to bring out the design.

            <h2>The cheesecake factory Ad</h2>
            <p>This is a print ad for ‘The Cheesecake Factory’ as part of my copywriting class. Cheesecakes always reminded me of Ms. Pac Man machine and so my print ad shows a Pac Man game highlighting the cheesecake factory’s numerous flavors.
